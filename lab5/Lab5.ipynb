    "- Natural Language Processing or NLP for short refers to a branch of Computer Science (to be more specific it is a branch of Artificial Intelligence or AI) where computers can understand text or spoken word in the same way humans can.\n",
    "- NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old.

      "Oatmeal is good for you, but I have always hated the taste.  The Maple & Brown Sugar flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal has always been my favorite way to eat it.  I started with the regular version, then moved to the Lower Sugar option, and have finally settled on the Weight Control variety.  The Weight Control tastes great and smells like waffles.<br /><br />One reviewer of this product was disappointed by the fact that when he compared the Weight Control version to the regular Quaker Instant Oatmeal, he realized that Weight Control has the same number of calories (160) and more fat (3g instead of 1g), but you need to analyze the products as a whole.  There may be more fat in the Weight Control, but if you look at the other components of the product, you'll see that Weight Control has fewer calories coming from carbohydrates (29g instead of 33g), BUT it has two times more dietary fiber (6g instead of 3g) and a lot less sugar (1g instead of 13g!).  More dietary fiber and less sugar is what you should really be looking for in your carbs anyway.  Weight Control also has almost twice as much protein as regular (7g instead of 4g).<br /><br />There is more to think about with your food than how much fat it contains.  Quaker Instant Oatmeal Weight Control fit my family's needs, but you should make sure you really look at the different products' nutritional information.  You can compare Quaker's products on their website: [...].\n",

The description on site says 100% kalamata.<br />Sending it back.....<br />UPDATE<br />The same day I wrote this review I was contacted by Mr. Alexander Mallas, with SuperOlive.com, the seller. 650-591-1010 .<br />He explained that the product description was written by the Martinis Company,the manufacturer.<br />The Kalamata is the region in Greece where the olives are grown, not necessarily kalamata olives.<br />I never knew there was such a place.  The seller plans on clarifing this in their description.<br />Mr. Mallas did say he attended an olive oil convention in Greece and found that the locals make their own kalamata olive oil for themselves and it is not readily available to the public.  The quest will continue....<br />It was a pleasure discussing the many different grades and types of olive oil. I plan on reading the book,<br />Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandale, by Tom Mueller, which he recommended.  I heard the program on NPR, with this review.<br />The Martinis oil I have he said I can keep, with an acidy level of .8 ( whatever that means ) I would only use it to fry fish, or other foods.<br />I am satisfied with the response, in fact Mr. Mallas is a colorfull man, and would look forward to another discussion after completing my<br />education.

      "The reason I purchased this product is for the \"No Sugar Added\" clause. I am annoyed with all the sugar that is added in almost everything. Every kids cocoa drink has too much sugar added. After I tasted my first drink, it felt  too sweet and had an after taste. The taste of an artificial sweetener. After checking the ingredients, I noticed it contains \"Sucralose\". According to Wikipedia, Sucralose is 600 sweeter than table sugar! What's the point of buying something that has no sugar added but adding something that's tons of times sweeter? I am not going after the calorie factor. So does Nesquick add 600 times less amount of Sucralose than sugar to get the same sweetness? I don't think so.<br /><br />Another major problem is that Amazon's ingredients section does NOT mention Sucralose. It mentions Aspartame which, according to Wikipedia, it's 100-150 times sweeter than sugar, which means much less sweeter than Sucralose. So did Nesquick change their ingredients and Amazon did not update their ingredients list?\n",

      "I have purchased other teas for my Keurig, but none have produced as strong of a flavor as this Bigelow Earl Grey. I have tried all kinds  of brands and blends of tea K-Cups, but none can compare to these. I drink tea rather than coffee, and I like my tea BOLD. I also have found with certain other brands, I ended up with a muddy watter appearance from the K-Cups, but never with Bigelow's. I have never once had a problem with tea leaves in my cup, and never get the \"tea dust\" at the bottom of my cup like with other brands.<br /><br />I would say if you have been disappointed in the past with other Brands of K-Cup Earl Grey, try these. They are the best out there.\n",

So there is no problem using the large cup setting. The price per cup is the best I've found. It seems they economize with the k-cup design and not by skimping on the amount of coffee. Of course you're buying 80 cups, so you hope you're going to like it. So far, I do.\n",

      "I like salted cashews to begin with...and I just discovered that a good sprinkling of pepper makes them even better.  The taste is great. All that fruity sweetness in a cashew is brought out by the pepper. These nuts have plenty of salt and enough paper to leave the tiniest burn on the tongue.  The peppery flavor enhances the taste of the cashew and heat is just the right intensity. If you have an ultra-sensitve or immature palette and cannot abide anything spicy, you may want to give these a miss. But if like a little bite in your bite, you'll gobble these goodies down. Serve them with beer, alongside a sandwich plate, or tossed on top of any salad. They'll add a little crunch and terrific flavor.  I liked the Cocoa-poweder dusted almonds that Emerald recently introduced. They are subtle, unusual and delicate. These cashews, on the other hand, are bold...all that salt and pepper pack a lot of flavor into every nut.  The taste is so intense that one handful is very satisfying...good news for us who like to watch our calories.\n",

The BBQ, Salt & Vinegar, and Cheddar are really good alone (and I'm not normally a BBQ chip person).  I tend to eat the Original, Sour Cream & Onion , and the Salt & Pepper with Laughing Cow Cheese as a dip.  I don't really care for the salt & pepper as much as the others because I don't really like pepper in general and these are very peppery.  I wish they would replace the salt & pepper with the parmesan garlic flavor.<br /><br />Also, I like to buy these small packages to limit my portion size, but also because there are a lot of chips in this one little bag.  It also makes it really convenient for me to grab a few bags and take them to work or throw a few in the car.  I don't have kids but the small bags would be nice for kids as well.\n",

      "I must admit, I haven't gotten many gift baskets in my time. If this one is any indication of what a gift basket is like, Iam not missing anything!!!!<br /><br />To start with, the gift basket is wrapped in cellophane, with a wide dark brown ribbon, with a sticker that says Back Mountain Gift Baskets.  The basket looks like a generic, cheap looking Easter basket, with two handles, one on each side of the basket.  Iam not sure what they are made of.  Inside where the items are, they are nestled in what looks like straw.<br /><br />Now, on to the items inside.<br /><br />1.  A wrapped box that says Kenzi All Natural Dark Napolitans.  Inside that is a box of Raisinettes.  Inside of that is 6 individual, small, solid dark chocolate, thin, red  wrapped bars, which had a gray tinge to them.<br /><br />2.  Next was a wrapped Chocolate Chip Crispie Marshmallow Bar it said on the package.  Inside was a box of Goya Spanish Flan Style Custard..  Inside that was a rice crispie bar with small chocolate chips.  I took a bite of it.  It was not nearly as good as the rice crispie bars you can make at home.  Not by a longshot!!<br /><br />3.  Next was a box of Venus Stoned Wheat Wafers. Inside were 3 cracker wafers.<br /><br />4.  Next was a Lindt Lindor Truffles Mint Chocolate package.  There were 3 inside, individually wrapped.<br /><br />5.Next was a Belgin Truffles box, with 4 individually wrapped inside.<br /><br />6.  Next was a Italian Herb Cheese Spread Box, 3.5 ounces, in a white plastic container.<br /><br />7.  Next was a box of Caramels Fleur De Sel.  Inside that was a box of Crystal Light Lemonade Box.  Inside that was 5 individually wrapped caramels.<br /><br />8.  Next was a box of Ferrara Milk Chocolate Covered Raisins Box, with grayish what looks like covered raisins.<br /><br />9.  Next was a box that said Milk Chocolate Napolitans.  Inside that was a Royal box of cherry gelatin.  Inside that is 6 individual, thin, small brown wrapped bars.  Like the Dark, Kenzi All Natural Napolitans.  They too had a grayish tinge to them.<br /><br />10.  Next was a box of Cafe Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee Bars. Inside was 4 Coffee Vergano thin, solid packaged bars.  Not sure it it's coffee or not.<br /><br />11 and 12.  Next was a one ounce bag of Trophy Farms All Natural Oven Roasted Peanuts, and a one ounce bag of Trophy Farms All Natural Fruit and Nuts.<br /><br />13.  Next was a sachet type box of Ernest Hemingway Highland Select Tea with 4 individually wrapped Ernest Hemingway tea bags.<br /><br />14.  Next was a box that said Stauffer's Original Recipe Ginger Snaps.  Inside was a box that said Stauffer's Original Animal Crackers.  Inside of that was a 2.3 ounce package of Stauffer's Original Recipe Ginger Snaps.<br /><br />I didn't see any coffee that I know of, and I definitely did not see any salami as stated in the description that I read.<br /><br />When I asked to receive this basket, by the description it sounded like it would be a United Nations Basket, with items from other countries which intrigued me.  Instead each item was made in the United States.<br /><br />Sadly, I would have much preferred the fake boxes of Jello, Crystal Light, Flan Custard, and Animal Crackers, rather than what the real items was.  At least I recognized the fake boxes, and they would have actually been something I could have used.<br /><br />What I got, most of it I plan to throw away.<br /><br />If in the description it says with a celebration in mind, the joke is on me, or I didn't get the joke, even tho I do have a good sense of humor.<br /><br />The endless unwrapping of each item, I wouldn't have minded if they had been quality items, but when I was finished unwrapping everything I was  just glad it was over!!<br /><br />I don't at this point know what this gift basket will be selling for, but to me, even a dollar would be too much!<br /><br />This basket was more like a gag gift to me.  I didn't find it funny at all!! I definitely would NOT send this to someone else, especially if it were someone I loved, or even liked, unless you are trying to get even with someone, but I couldn't even do that!<br /><br />In a nutshell, I am disappointed, to say the least! This just proves to me, that what you see online when you order something, it may not be what you thought at all when you actually do receive what you ordered!!<br /><br />These are my opinions only.  Someone else might enjoy this gift basket. I didn't!  It's cheap looking, the items inside are cheap looking, etc.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I did receive another gift basket today. The one that I received today was NOT the same gift basket that I had received when I wrote my original review above.<br /><br />By that I mean the gift basket that I received today was NOT the original one that I got, not the prototype above, but not even the same gift basket that I had received minus the wierdness, tackyness, and about a hundred other words that I could write to give a description of the FIRST nightmare of a gift basket that I had received.<br /><br />The only similarity from the original gift basket and then this second gift basket is that it's the same gift basket, but the one I received today is a darker color.  Everything else about it is the same as the first gift basket I received, the actual basket.<br /><br />There was a note taped to the outside of this gift basket showing that the orginal gift basket I received was a pre-production, prototype, mock-up that was never intended to be released to the general public.  I HOPE NOT!!!<br /><br />It never occured to me that any gift basket I would ever receive would not be the one that anyone else would have received.<br /><br />Obviously this company needs better quality control, because the one I originally received I never would have let it see the light of day, period.<br /><br />I was hoping that the gift basket that I received today would be the one I originally was supposed to receive to see how it really should have been, but the one I got today is an entirely different gift basket all together.<br /><br />The gift basket I received today was one entirely devoted to coffee, period.  It included:<br /><br />1.  A can of Ground Irish Coffee- 1.75 ounces. The brand is Bewley's Of Ireland, but on the back of the can it says Comfort Foods, Inc.  North Andover, MA.  I will be giving this coffee away.  I can't stand anything that is Irish Cream, no matter what it is.<br /><br />2.  3 packets of different ground coffees, each 1.3 ounces, in flavors of Breakfast Blend, Amaretto Royale, and Moca Java, from a company called Arbuckle's.  The city is Verona, PA.  Each packet of coffee is supposed to make about 10 cups of coffee depending on how strong you like it.<br /><br />3. A coffee mug that says a warm mug of Coffee, the best at igourment.com.  Your standard sized mug.  The writing is in a brown color, the mug itself is like an off white/beige color.  I will also be giving this mug away.  It's just not the kind of mug that I use either for coffee or tea.  The mug is ok, for what it is.<br /><br />4.  A small box that says Sugar in the raw, that has 6 packets.  I know I can buy this same brand in any grocery store.<br /><br />4.  A taller box that says Creamer for your coffee.  Inside that box is 10 packets of a generic looking non-dairy creamer.  I will also be giving this away as I don't use powdered creamer at all, but a liquid flavored creamer.<br /><br />5.A taller box that says Coffee Stirrers.  Inside that are 9 wooden coffee stirrers, like a thin popsicle stick. They aren't even plastic coffee stirrers!<br /><br />6.  A roll of King Original Peppermints which I assume is some kind of mints- 1.55 ounces.<br /><br />7.  A box of Caffe' Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee- 0.83 ounces.  I did receive this same thing in my first gift basket.  They taste like almond cookies.  The box says Product of Italy, but on the back of the box the state shown is PA.  Hardly Italy!<br /><br />8.  Several small packets of biscuit type cookies, to have with coffee.  About 6 of those total.<br /><br />In summary this gift basket was not the tacky, etc one like the first gift basket that I received, but I wouldn't call this one great either.  I wouldn't send this gift basket to anyone I know.  It doesn't look gourmet to me at all.<br /><br />The only things I will be keeping are the packets of coffee, the sugar in the raw, tho as a rule I don't use sugar period, and never in coffee.  I just use flavored liquid creamer in my coffee, and maybe the basket.  The rest I will be giving away.<br /><br />It's really hard to give an update since this second gift basket is not like the first one I received as far as the contents of the basket.<br /><br />I hate to say this, and I will leave it up to anyone who cares to read my review as to if they want to purchase either of these gift baskets or any others from this company, but I  don't like this company, period.<br /><br />They lack any imagination as far as the products/packaging they include in their gift baskets, which if I had to rate the gift baskets based soley on the contents of what was included in either gift basket, I would have to say the first gift basket I received had more variety than this second gift basket did.  I could see what the contents of the first gift basket would have contained, minus all of the wierd packaging that it had, tho some of the products of that one looked old, non-edible.  I threw most of that one away, period.  I didn't even give any of that gift basket away.<br /><br />My real question and my summary of this company is if it's named igourmet, where is the gourmet in their products?  Also, they are supposed to be products that are not from the U.S.A., but once again both gift baskets contained items only from the U.S.A.<br /><br />Most of what they include in their gift baskets, I could find either the same products or higher quality products than theirs in any grocery store.<br /><br />Like I said, it's hard to update a review if the gift baskets are entirely different, how can you compare them to post a review?  All I can do which is what I did in my first review, and that is to state what products were included in this second gift basket, and leave the rest of it up to any potential buyers out there who are considering purchasing a gift basket from this or any other company.<br /><br />I do appreciate getting a second gift basket, which after the first one I was kind of dreading what I would receive in this second gift basket, but this one too does NOT have any wow factor, or quality look to it.<br /><br />To me, especially if it were something like a gift basket it would not only be about the products included, which would be high quality products, but quality packaging too which I enjoy trying products from other companies, perhaps products I had never tried before, but to me it's not only about the items included in the gift basket, but the presentation too matters to me.  It shouldn't show cheap.<br /><br />Also, I don't understand how any company who specializes in gift baskets would include items that you could easily find in any grocery store, but their's is lower quality.<br /><br />How much thought goes into this companies gift baskets?  If I were a company who made gift baskets, I would want it to look like alot of thought went into what they included in their gift basket, from the items they include to their packaging, etc.  It's the total package that matters to me in the end.  I would want my gift baskets to be memorable, thoughtful and enjoyable.  With this company their gift baskets are forgettable, sadly.<br /><br />If I had to rate this second gift basket by how many stars I would give it, I would have to give it a 2, and that is being generous.<br /><br />Sorry, that is just how I see it!\n",

      "I bought these one day when I was craving a bagel, wanted something with whole grain, and I was, well, being lazy. I really wanted a bagel but I didn't feel like going to a bagel shop. I was already in the grocery store, walking through the bread isle, so it was an impulse buy pure and simple. In short, I was extremely disappointed. For my full review, see below.<br /><br />I have to think the only reasons anyone would give this product a good rating is either because they've never eaten a real bagel or they're in denial and are allowing themselves to think it's good because they're so desperate for a way to eat what they think is a bagel and still feel like they're eating healthy. Well, it's not a \"real\" bagel (not even close) and it's not even healthy. Why do I say this?<br /><br />~<br /><br />NOT A REAL BAGEL:<br /><br />The only similarities between Thomas' Bagels (or Bagel Thins) and real bagels is the round shape and the whole in the middle. Other than that these so-called bagels are nothing more than fluffy bread shaped like  a bagel. Upon close inspection and taste-testing it looks, tastes, and feels just like regular bread. It's extremely bland, even with the \"whole wheat\" it supposedly includes. I'm from an area of the country that makes REAL BAGELS (NYC and surrounding area) so I know what I speak of.<br /><br />True, traditional bagels should not be whole wheat, but I have eaten a whole wheat bagel made in a real bagel shop and these aren't even close to a real bagel. I've been eating true bagels made by hand for over 50 years. When you compare these things to real bagels it's almost a joke to call these things bagels.<br /><br />Bagels should be dense, chewy, and stiff. This is not. This is a limp, soft piece of floppy fluffy bread. I could ball one up in my hand like Wonder bread, that's how fluffy and soft they are. And bagels should be crispy when toasted. This is not, unless you over toast it to the point it's nearly burnt.<br /><br />~<br /><br />NOT HEALTHY:<br /><br />One of the reasons I bought these specific \"bagels\" was for the whole wheat. I thought it would be healthier than a regular bagel. WRONG! It contains stuff in it that I've never even heard of before and I'm sure are not \"healthy\" or wholesome ingredients. Like datem - what the heck is DATEM? It also contains stuff that shouldn't be in a bagel.<br /><br />~<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Basic bagels should contain wheat flour, salt, water, and yeast leavening. That's it!<br /><br />REAL BAGELS CONTAIN:<br />Wheat Flour<br />Salt<br />Water<br />Yeast<br /><br />THOMAS' CONTAINS:<br />Wheat Flour<br />Water<br />Sugar<br />Wheat Gluten<br />Flaked Wheat<br />Cellulouse Fiber<br />Cornmeal<br />Yeast<br />Wheat Bran<br />Salt<br />Preservatives (calcium propionate, sorbic acid)<br />Monoglycerides<br />Guar Gum<br />Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate<br />Datem<br />Soybean Oil<br />Soy Flour<br /><br />Now, I do realize some of the non-traditional ingredients found in these \"bagels\" are there because they are supposed to be a \"whole wheat\" product (traditional bagels are not whole wheat), but that does not excuse the Cornmeal, Guar Gum, Datem, Soy Flour, Soy Oil, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Monoglycerides, Calcium Propionate, and Sorbic Acid.<br /><br />~<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />If you want a bagel go to a bagel shop. If you live in an area where they are not made (or not made correctly) I suggest you make friends with someone in NY and ask them to send you a box of bagels. Even if you freeze them and eat them later they'll taste 100% better than any grocery store bagel I'm sure.<br /><br />I'll most likely get myself some real bagels from a real bagel shop in the near future, and when I do I'll post photos or a video that shows the difference - which will tell you a lot because these things are so bad you can tell just from a photo, you don't even have to taste them (although I did).\n",

      "And we find her here upon this grand amazon!<br /><br />Each day Morinu feeds me like my own nourishing mother, cherishes and consents my whims with this wonderful food.<br /><br />Eschew all animal byproducts and cadavers.<br /><br />This tofu is a strengthening food, fit for human consumption.<br /><br />And so convenient from our mighty amazon, sent right to your front porch or, in my case, post office box with free shipping rather than driving thirty to seventy five miles for the same product at three times the price, plus gas.<br /><br />This is fit food for humans, food for which our bodies are created, food which feeds us rather than kills both the source and the consumer.<br /><br />You may read here written by the self-deceived that this tofu is too mushy for firmness and that it must be pressed between towels before cooking. To them so confused I ask<br /><br />Cooking?<br /><br />Each day at least once a day, I draw forth my serrated knife, and one sacrificial box of this excellent tofu, and I without remorse slice a hole in its top, with great tenderness and care and gratitude, releasing only the slightest and most apologetic gentle spurt of clearest liquid.<br /><br />And this with a certain yearning.<br /><br />I do not observe the indications written sternly upon the short edge of the box, but lie this box gently down upon a smooth flat slab of wood, with the face up, and take the knife very gently sliding upon on edge of the top, the very belly of the box, and then upon the other edge of this top, and then most gently along the bottom edge of this top, each time releasing apologetically the slightest hint of a clear liquid, revealing thusly by means of these three slits the gentle hidden secrets of the box, the soft white substance lying shyly within, awaiting with embarrassment our further processing.<br /><br />I feel the need to explain this procedure with greater care and attention. The very tip, the point of the knife, uncovers tenderly a certain point a certain distance from the corner of the broad top of the box, the side with the picture and product label, as pictured here, the side which reads Morinu, the broad flat side laid flat. The very tip of the knife, I say, discovers probingly a certain point near one corner which offers the proper resistance without too great a resistance, without too little a resistance, to penetrate this membrane. Too close to the corner is found to be too hard, too resistant, too unwilling, although most convenient for the later proceedings. Too distant from the corner implies simply random slashings without specific purpose, and our purpose in this procedure is most serious, most purposeful, intent.<br /><br />In a word therefore the point of the knife penetrates the membrane slowly yet purposefully as close to the corner as possible, penetrating as deeply as possible without piercing the wooden slab beneath. A certain spurt of clear liquid may emerge, but let this prove no inhibition, as the knife reaches the depth of the box. Slowly withdraw the knife, slowly, at a diagonal, allowing the serration softly with friction to continue to separate a slight slit along the ege of the box, slowly, resolutely but patiently, with purpose, as the serration creates an ever longer slit along that edge, as closely as possible.<br /><br />Continue from this first slit along the the contiguous edge of the top of this box, and then the third edge, inserting carefully your knife, and slowly withdrawing with a friction sufficient to separate the membrane without shredding, without eliciting over muchly the clear liquid which may spurt forth.<br /><br />Let us call the top right corner of the box Point A, the bottom right corner Point B, the left bottom corner Point C and the upper left corner Point D. Begin to pierce at Point A, proceed in turn to B, to C, ending at D, forming this a slit along the three edges. Arriving at Point D, withdraw the knife completely, wipe the blade with a soft, dry cloth and set it aside for cleansing. We now may lift the flap thus created, exposing the delicate white contents within.<br /><br />I feel remiss if I do not address a probable misconception here writtenonly for the rhetorical convenience, and I feel compelled by the necesity of correcting this counter-indication, no matter how unclear this may be, due only to my severely limiting literary incapacities.<br /><br />Employing the same alphabetical coordinates as described above, the consumer may discover this procedure far more efficacious: to begin at Point A and proceed gently yet firmly to point B as described. Divergently, however, please proceed to point D (!) and then directly by knife edge to point C, parallel to the Line AB already created, yet along the opposing edge. Having thusly formed two parallel slits, find the midpoint between Point B and Point C as close to the edge as possible, probing and then plunging the tip of the knife through the cardboard membrane, through to the bottom of the box, but now with an orientation perpendicular to that previously used in the formation of lines AB and DC. Withdraw slowly, delicately, yet with sufficient friction at an angle to proceed effectively to the corner at Point B. Withdraw completely and reverse the knife blade, returning it deeply at the midpoint previously entered. Withdraw once more with similar care, and opposite diagonal, completing the slit thus formed entirely to Point C. I am confident the consumer may discover this procedure far more delightful and effective than any here previously described.<br /><br />Firmly we roll back the top flap created by the three slits. Proceed mercilessly, proceed, not frenetically, but ardently nevertheless, to dice within the selfsame box her contents, slowly, gently, but decisively. The fresh tip of my serrated knife, which in recent memory has touched no animal part, but vegetable alone, and never shall become so adulterate with the blood of the animal, with the dairy of the animal, this sanctified and reserved and faithful tip, having never known in any sense animal but only vegetable, purified thus, unadulterate, this sacred knife dares therefore pierce this gentle pure white tofu into a ruthless grid of slits, fully through to the bottom box, plunging first vertically in rhythmically repeated rows spaced gently a few centimeters apart, and then, relentlessly, horizontally, pushing ever so softly through the yielding, unresisting white tofu laid back upon the flat slab, awaiting without a word this process, with utter patience, yielding.<br /><br />Completed this repeated slicing, back and forth, up and down, across, and through, and through, I lift in one hand upwards the entire box gently, yet unrelentingly, over the recipient reserved for this purpose alone. Most often it is the daily lunch container, reusable, with soft top, to receive the more securely and gently this daily offering, removed demurely from its box, as cautiously as a hermit crab from its borrowed shell, vulnerable by exposure. With one finger one may remove whatever residue remains relunctly within the package, passing it reassuringly into the ultimate recipient.<br /><br />Lime juice freshly squeezed upon the tofu deposited there, as ablution, meets fragrant sprigs of fresh green cilantro mated with whole <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMFCRU\">Corriander Seeds 7oz</a>, and a generous ladling of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZU7QQ\">Eden Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12)</a> also available upon this generously nutrient amazon. This is a meal in itself, and comes most welcome at noon.<br /><br />At night rather than such a cold lunch, in this cold winter a warmer meal is wanted, and so this gentle and yielding box of nutritious tofu might discover herself pushed gently into a saucepan of simmering miso soup, such as, perhaps, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RMB4WI\">Shiro Miso Paste NON GMO No MSG Added</a>. This miso soup would take far greater space to describe here in the making. From this container of miso paste draw forth a goodly spoonful to introduce slowly, most politely, into a gently heating small saucepan of water. Later, in place of seaweed and to deceive my own palate, I place those small flat spinach leaves available in the organic department of your local market, perhaps with the results of a small onion diced very carefully in the manner approved as described above, or green onion.<br /><br />When quite ready for dinner, I add last of all to this essence this gentle box of tofu, sliced as described above, with great and tender care, leaving it bathing one might dare say, only long enough to warm through and through, before eating.<br /><br />A veritable meal in itself.<br /><br />There are so many other manners in which to use, and to abuse, this pure, white and utterly nutritious gentle product, and I can only with my utmost recommendation say, and this with my greatest gratitude, that here at long last we may know a food most willingly fit for our human consumption, and one most readily available upon this wonderful amazon.\n",

      "I must admit, I haven't gotten many gift baskets in my time. If this one is any indication of what a gift basket is like, Iam not missing anything!!!!<br /><br />To start with, the gift basket is wrapped in cellophane, with a wide dark brown ribbon, with a sticker that says Back Mountain Gift Baskets.  The basket looks like a generic, cheap looking Easter basket, with two handles, one on each side of the basket.  Iam not sure what they are made of.  Inside where the items are, they are nestled in what looks like straw.<br /><br />Now, on to the items inside.<br /><br />1.  A wrapped box that says Kenzi All Natural Dark Napolitans.  Inside that is a box of Raisinettes.  Inside of that is 6 individual, small, solid dark chocolate, thin, red  wrapped bars, which had a gray tinge to them.<br /><br />2.  Next was a wrapped Chocolate Chip Crispie Marshmallow Bar it said on the package.  Inside was a box of Goya Spanish Flan Style Custard..  Inside that was a rice crispie bar with small chocolate chips.  I took a bite of it.  It was not nearly as good as the rice crispie bars you can make at home.  Not by a longshot!!<br /><br />3.  Next was a box of Venus Stoned Wheat Wafers. Inside were 3 cracker wafers.<br /><br />4.  Next was a Lindt Lindor Truffles Mint Chocolate package.  There were 3 inside, individually wrapped.<br /><br />5.Next was a Belgin Truffles box, with 4 individually wrapped inside.<br /><br />6.  Next was a Italian Herb Cheese Spread Box, 3.5 ounces, in a white plastic container.<br /><br />7.  Next was a box of Caramels Fleur De Sel.  Inside that was a box of Crystal Light Lemonade Box.  Inside that was 5 individually wrapped caramels.<br /><br />8.  Next was a box of Ferrara Milk Chocolate Covered Raisins Box, with grayish what looks like covered raisins.<br /><br />9.  Next was a box that said Milk Chocolate Napolitans.  Inside that was a Royal box of cherry gelatin.  Inside that is 6 individual, thin, small brown wrapped bars.  Like the Dark, Kenzi All Natural Napolitans.  They too had a grayish tinge to them.<br /><br />10.  Next was a box of Cafe Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee Bars. Inside was 4 Coffee Vergano thin, solid packaged bars.  Not sure it it's coffee or not.<br /><br />11 and 12.  Next was a one ounce bag of Trophy Farms All Natural Oven Roasted Peanuts, and a one ounce bag of Trophy Farms All Natural Fruit and Nuts.<br /><br />13.  Next was a sachet type box of Ernest Hemingway Highland Select Tea with 4 individually wrapped Ernest Hemingway tea bags.<br /><br />14.  Next was a box that said Stauffer's Original Recipe Ginger Snaps.  Inside was a box that said Stauffer's Original Animal Crackers.  Inside of that was a 2.3 ounce package of Stauffer's Original Recipe Ginger Snaps.<br /><br />I didn't see any coffee that I know of, and I definitely did not see any salami as stated in the description that I read.<br /><br />When I asked to receive this basket, by the description it sounded like it would be a United Nations Basket, with items from other countries which intrigued me.  Instead each item was made in the United States.<br /><br />Sadly, I would have much preferred the fake boxes of Jello, Crystal Light, Flan Custard, and Animal Crackers, rather than what the real items was.  At least I recognized the fake boxes, and they would have actually been something I could have used.<br /><br />What I got, most of it I plan to throw away.<br /><br />If in the description it says with a celebration in mind, the joke is on me, or I didn't get the joke, even tho I do have a good sense of humor.<br /><br />The endless unwrapping of each item, I wouldn't have minded if they had been quality items, but when I was finished unwrapping everything I was  just glad it was over!!<br /><br />I don't at this point know what this gift basket will be selling for, but to me, even a dollar would be too much!<br /><br />This basket was more like a gag gift to me.  I didn't find it funny at all!! I definitely would NOT send this to someone else, especially if it were someone I loved, or even liked, unless you are trying to get even with someone, but I couldn't even do that!<br /><br />In a nutshell, I am disappointed, to say the least! This just proves to me, that what you see online when you order something, it may not be what you thought at all when you actually do receive what you ordered!!<br /><br />These are my opinions only.  Someone else might enjoy this gift basket. I didn't!  It's cheap looking, the items inside are cheap looking, etc.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I did receive another gift basket today. The one that I received today was NOT the same gift basket that I had received when I wrote my original review above.<br /><br />By that I mean the gift basket that I received today was NOT the original one that I got, not the prototype above, but not even the same gift basket that I had received minus the wierdness, tackyness, and about a hundred other words that I could write to give a description of the FIRST nightmare of a gift basket that I had received.<br /><br />The only similarity from the original gift basket and then this second gift basket is that it's the same gift basket, but the one I received today is a darker color.  Everything else about it is the same as the first gift basket I received, the actual basket.<br /><br />There was a note taped to the outside of this gift basket showing that the orginal gift basket I received was a pre-production, prototype, mock-up that was never intended to be released to the general public.  I HOPE NOT!!!<br /><br />It never occured to me that any gift basket I would ever receive would not be the one that anyone else would have received.<br /><br />Obviously this company needs better quality control, because the one I originally received I never would have let it see the light of day, period.<br /><br />I was hoping that the gift basket that I received today would be the one I originally was supposed to receive to see how it really should have been, but the one I got today is an entirely different gift basket all together.<br /><br />The gift basket I received today was one entirely devoted to coffee, period.  It included:<br /><br />1.  A can of Ground Irish Coffee- 1.75 ounces. The brand is Bewley's Of Ireland, but on the back of the can it says Comfort Foods, Inc.  North Andover, MA.  I will be giving this coffee away.  I can't stand anything that is Irish Cream, no matter what it is.<br /><br />2.  3 packets of different ground coffees, each 1.3 ounces, in flavors of Breakfast Blend, Amaretto Royale, and Moca Java, from a company called Arbuckle's.  The city is Verona, PA.  Each packet of coffee is supposed to make about 10 cups of coffee depending on how strong you like it.<br /><br />3. A coffee mug that says a warm mug of Coffee, the best at igourment.com.  Your standard sized mug.  The writing is in a brown color, the mug itself is like an off white/beige color.  I will also be giving this mug away.  It's just not the kind of mug that I use either for coffee or tea.  The mug is ok, for what it is.<br /><br />4.  A small box that says Sugar in the raw, that has 6 packets.  I know I can buy this same brand in any grocery store.<br /><br />4.  A taller box that says Creamer for your coffee.  Inside that box is 10 packets of a generic looking non-dairy creamer.  I will also be giving this away as I don't use powdered creamer at all, but a liquid flavored creamer.<br /><br />5.A taller box that says Coffee Stirrers.  Inside that are 9 wooden coffee stirrers, like a thin popsicle stick. They aren't even plastic coffee stirrers!<br /><br />6.  A roll of King Original Peppermints which I assume is some kind of mints- 1.55 ounces.<br /><br />7.  A box of Caffe' Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee- 0.83 ounces.  I did receive this same thing in my first gift basket.  They taste like almond cookies.  The box says Product of Italy, but on the back of the box the state shown is PA.  Hardly Italy!<br /><br />8.  Several small packets of biscuit type cookies, to have with coffee.  About 6 of those total.<br /><br />In summary this gift basket was not the tacky, etc one like the first gift basket that I received, but I wouldn't call this one great either.  I wouldn't send this gift basket to anyone I know.  It doesn't look gourmet to me at all.<br /><br />The only things I will be keeping are the packets of coffee, the sugar in the raw, tho as a rule I don't use sugar period, and never in coffee.  I just use flavored liquid creamer in my coffee, and maybe the basket.  The rest I will be giving away.<br /><br />It's really hard to give an update since this second gift basket is not like the first one I received as far as the contents of the basket.<br /><br />I hate to say this, and I will leave it up to anyone who cares to read my review as to if they want to purchase either of these gift baskets or any others from this company, but I  don't like this company, period.<br /><br />They lack any imagination as far as the products/packaging they include in their gift baskets, which if I had to rate the gift baskets based soley on the contents of what was included in either gift basket, I would have to say the first gift basket I received had more variety than this second gift basket did.  I could see what the contents of the first gift basket would have contained, minus all of the wierd packaging that it had, tho some of the products of that one looked old, non-edible.  I threw most of that one away, period.  I didn't even give any of that gift basket away.<br /><br />My real question and my summary of this company is if it's named igourmet, where is the gourmet in their products?  Also, they are supposed to be products that are not from the U.S.A., but once again both gift baskets contained items only from the U.S.A.<br /><br />Most of what they include in their gift baskets, I could find either the same products or higher quality products than theirs in any grocery store.<br /><br />Like I said, it's hard to update a review if the gift baskets are entirely different, how can you compare them to post a review?  All I can do which is what I did in my first review, and that is to state what products were included in this second gift basket, and leave the rest of it up to any potential buyers out there who are considering purchasing a gift basket from this or any other company.<br /><br />I do appreciate getting a second gift basket, which after the first one I was kind of dreading what I would receive in this second gift basket, but this one too does NOT have any wow factor, or quality look to it.<br /><br />To me, especially if it were something like a gift basket it would not only be about the products included, which would be high quality products, but quality packaging too which I enjoy trying products from other companies, perhaps products I had never tried before, but to me it's not only about the items included in the gift basket, but the presentation too matters to me.  It shouldn't show cheap.<br /><br />Also, I don't understand how any company who specializes in gift baskets would include items that you could easily find in any grocery store, but their's is lower quality.<br /><br />How much thought goes into this companies gift baskets?  If I were a company who made gift baskets, I would want it to look like alot of thought went into what they included in their gift basket, from the items they include to their packaging, etc.  It's the total package that matters to me in the end.  I would want my gift baskets to be memorable, thoughtful and enjoyable.  With this company their gift baskets are forgettable, sadly.<br /><br />If I had to rate this second gift basket by how many stars I would give it, I would have to give it a 2, and that is being generous.<br /><br />Sorry, that is just how I see it!\n",

      "I bought these one day when I was craving a bagel, wanted something with whole grain, and I was, well, being lazy. I really wanted a bagel but I didn't feel like going to a bagel shop. I was already in the grocery store, walking through the bread isle, so it was an impulse buy pure and simple. In short, I was extremely disappointed. For my full review, see below.<br /><br />I have to think the only reasons anyone would give this product a good rating is either because they've never eaten a real bagel or they're in denial and are allowing themselves to think it's good because they're so desperate for a way to eat what they think is a bagel and still feel like they're eating healthy. Well, it's not a \"real\" bagel (not even close) and it's not even healthy. Why do I say this?<br /><br />~<br /><br />NOT A REAL BAGEL:<br /><br />The only similarities between Thomas' Bagels (or Bagel Thins) and real bagels is the round shape and the whole in the middle. Other than that these so-called bagels are nothing more than fluffy bread shaped like  a bagel. Upon close inspection and taste-testing it looks, tastes, and feels just like regular bread. It's extremely bland, even with the \"whole wheat\" it supposedly includes. I'm from an area of the country that makes REAL BAGELS (NYC and surrounding area) so I know what I speak of.<br /><br />True, traditional bagels should not be whole wheat, but I have eaten a whole wheat bagel made in a real bagel shop and these aren't even close to a real bagel. I've been eating true bagels made by hand for over 50 years. When you compare these things to real bagels it's almost a joke to call these things bagels.<br /><br />Bagels should be dense, chewy, and stiff. This is not. This is a limp, soft piece of floppy fluffy bread. I could ball one up in my hand like Wonder bread, that's how fluffy and soft they are. And bagels should be crispy when toasted. This is not, unless you over toast it to the point it's nearly burnt.<br /><br />~<br /><br />NOT HEALTHY:<br /><br />One of the reasons I bought these specific \"bagels\" was for the whole wheat. I thought it would be healthier than a regular bagel. WRONG! It contains stuff in it that I've never even heard of before and I'm sure are not \"healthy\" or wholesome ingredients. Like datem - what the heck is DATEM? It also contains stuff that shouldn't be in a bagel.<br /><br />~<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Basic bagels should contain wheat flour, salt, water, and yeast leavening. That's it!<br /><br />REAL BAGELS CONTAIN:<br />Wheat Flour<br />Salt<br />Water<br />Yeast<br /><br />THOMAS' CONTAINS:<br />Wheat Flour<br />Water<br />Sugar<br />Wheat Gluten<br />Flaked Wheat<br />Cellulouse Fiber<br />Cornmeal<br />Yeast<br />Wheat Bran<br />Salt<br />Preservatives (calcium propionate, sorbic acid)<br />Monoglycerides<br />Guar Gum<br />Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate<br />Datem<br />Soybean Oil<br />Soy Flour<br /><br />Now, I do realize some of the non-traditional ingredients found in these \"bagels\" are there because they are supposed to be a \"whole wheat\" product (traditional bagels are not whole wheat), but that does not excuse the Cornmeal, Guar Gum, Datem, Soy Flour, Soy Oil, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Monoglycerides, Calcium Propionate, and Sorbic Acid.<br /><br />~<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />If you want a bagel go to a bagel shop. If you live in an area where they are not made (or not made correctly) I suggest you make friends with someone in NY and ask them to send you a box of bagels. Even if you freeze them and eat them later they'll taste 100% better than any grocery store bagel I'm sure.<br /><br />I'll most likely get myself some real bagels from a real bagel shop in the near future, and when I do I'll post photos or a video that shows the difference - which will tell you a lot because these things are so bad you can tell just from a photo, you don't even have to taste them (although I did).\n",

      "I had never tried this product before I was offered it through the vine. I eat Bear Naked granola daily, which is what I can compare this to.<br /><br />I was kind of unsure of the mixture of chocolate and granola. I had figured it was like steak flavored tofu, sure the taste is good but why? When I recieved the bag I was really delighted at the taste.<br /><br />It does not have a strong chocolate flavor. The small chocolate bits inside are tasty too. It also has LESS calories than Pure Protein from Bear Naked granola.<br /><br />Here are the specs:<br /><br />| Nutrition Facts<br />| Serving size 1/2 cup 50g<br />| Servings per container: about 7<br /><br />| Amount per serving:<br />| Calories 220 Calories from fat50<br />| Total fat: 6g 9%dv<br />| Sat fat: 2g 10%dv<br />| Trans fat 0g<br />| Polyunsaturated fat 1g<br />| Monounsaturated fat 2.5g<br />| Cholesterol 0mg 0% dv<br />| Sodium 5mg 0% dv<br />| Potassium 160mg 5% dv<br />| Total Carbohydrates 37g 12% dv<br />| Dietary fiber 4g 16% dv<br />| Sugar 13g<br />| Other Carbs 20g<br />| Protein: 5g<br /><br />| Vitamin A 0% o Vitamin C 0%<br />| Calcium 2% o Iron 10%<br />| Phosphorus 15%o Magnesium 15%<br />| Zinc 10% o Copper 15%<br /><br />Pros:<br />>> Great taste<br />>> Decent iron for vegetarians<br />>> Not too bad for calories per serving<br /><br />Cons:<br />>> Chocolate granola?<br />>> Not vegan (contains milk)<br /><br />Overall a great snack!<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.\n",

      "I have been a fan of Jasmine Tea for quite a while.  Several years ago,<br />I had my first taste of TWINNINGS Jasmine Tea, and fell in love with the<br />sweet, delicate flavour....totally different from even the \"English Breakfast Tea\" made by the same company.  Though \"English Breakfast Tea\",<br />(and \"Darjeeling\", and even Fortum & Mason's \"Royal Blend\" tea are different from the usual \"Orange Pekoe\" or \"Orange Pekoe and Black\" teas, one usually gets bagged in the supermarket, these other 'rarified' teas are far more like the usual tea than Jasmine Tea.  Jasmine Tea, (at least as made by Twinnings), will always be my total favourite.<br /><br />When I went to purchase some \"TWINNINGS Jasmine Tea\" through Amazon, they were out of it...thank goodness, as it turns out, temporarily.  I didn't know this at the time...and so, I bought the \"substitute\" then offered...Sunflower Jasmine Tea.  I figured that Jasmine Tea is Jasmine Tea, no matter who makes it ....right?  And this Sunflower Tea DID seem slightly less expensive....so, I bought some.<br /><br />I have just had my first cup.  It did NOT taste like the Jasmine Tea I so remember and appreciate.  This is a very, very PALE tea in colour....and what is worse, the taste is somewhat peppery, (ulgh!)....with only the VERY slightest hint of the wonderful Jasmine Tea Flavour I remember.<br /><br />WHAT went wrong, I wondered.  HOW could this be so different?  Tea trees<br />should know no nationality or political system!  I was extremely bewildered and confused....for about five minutes.  But I found out the reason, (I think), just before I started to write this review...seeking out the Sunflower Jasmine Tea for which I wanted to write a review.<br /><br />Amongst the \"Jasmine Teas\" listed are TWO TYPES of Twinnings Jasmine Tea.<br />One is \"Jasmine Tea\", the other \"Jasmine Green Tea\".  I suspect that THIS is the reason I so dislike the Jasmine Tea from Sunflower.  It is NOT \"straight\" Jasmine Tea...but MUST be Jasmine Green Tea.  And although Green Tea is said to have myriad health benefits, it sure doesn't make as tasty and satisfying a brew as Jasmine tea.  Even when, it seems, it is MIXED with Jasmine Tea.<br /><br />One would expect people in the People's Republic of China to know the difference!  And to label their tea accordingly!  Not everyone, (including me!) is a tea expert...and the difference between \"Jasmine Tea\" and \"Jasmine Green Tea\" should be noted on the tea-box label, for tea novices, such as I...as it is, thoughtfully, by Twinnings Teas.  I am, at present, extremely disappointed at the carelessness in labeling.<br />Those who want \"Jasmine Tea\" only will, I am sure, be likewise disappointed by this probably-mislabeled-by-mistake-or-by-carelessness \"Jasmine Tea\".  It is NOT \"Jasmine Tea\" to my palate -- it is, I am almost certain, \"Jasmine Green Tea\".  There is SUCH a difference in taste!!!!!!<br /><br />I know Green Tea is good for one, and so I will keep this tea.  I will combine it with the \"ordinary\" tea I find at the supermarket -- and which I find far more flavourful!  (NOTE: Second cup of tea -- even mixed with \"ordinary\" orange pekoe tea, (two tea-bags!), is not to my taste.  Therefore....as is listed in the \"NOTE: PS\",  below, I HAVE DECIDED I AM NOT KEEPING this tea, but am putting it up for sale, for those who enjoy Jasmine Green Tea, (obviously some people do, as reflected in the other, sterling reviews of this tea), and would like it -- 1 pound minus two servings -- at a bargain price.)<br /><br />However, this tea is certainly not to MY taste.  And so disappointed am I, that, unless there is a very, very great difference in price, I will stick to buying genuine,<br />\"JASMINE Tea\", from Twinnings, (who takes the time and trouble to carefully label each TYPE of Jasmine Tea), from now on -- even if Sunflower does decide to mend it's ways and re-label its tea!<br /><br />A great flavor disappointment -- due to careless labelling!<br /><br />.............................................................<br />.............................................................<br /><br />p.S.  NOTE:  Today, 12th March, 2009 -- two days after I have written this review -- and about 6 days after I have received this tea, I have FINALLY seen that, yes indeedy....the package DOES say, \"Green Tea With Jasmine Flowers\" -- on the BACK of the tin, in smallish lettering!  One cannot see the BACK of the tin from the Amazon.com illustration!  From the \"Product Description\", it states that \"Jasmine Tea is one of the most pleasant-tasting green teas available....\" -- but does NOT mention any differentiation between the two varieties: \"Jasmine Tea\", ane \"Jasmine Green Tea\" -- as Twinnings Teas thoughtfully does.  Even from the \"Proudct Description\", which probably has been supplied by Sunflower, a novice would STILL not know there are two distinct and different TYPES of Jasmine Tea!  AND THERE DEFINITELY ARE TWO VARIETIES: - I have been on the phone with my sister, and she concurs: she (also), LOVES plain Jasmine Tea, but detests Jasmine GREEN Tea.  But -- I suppopose there ARE those who enjoy Jasmine Green Tea, looking at the ohter sterling reviews of this same tea.<br /><br />I don't like it. But I'm glad that there are those who do like it.  I have had two cups of 5his tea -- and have revised my opinion about keeping it.  I am putting it up for sale, via my Amazon.com shop.  I may lose mnney in this transaction, but better that, (for me), than suffering through more of this Jasmine Green Tea.  Besides, there PROBABLY ARE others who like it.  I guess I'll not only be doing myself a favour -- but will also be doing my \"good deed\" for the day, by putting it up at a bargain price for those who truly enjoy Jasmine GREEN Tea!  If you want to buy it, it's here -- used only twice, at the aforesaid bargain price! (Hey, that rhymes!)<br /><br />Note to Sunflower Teas:  PLEASE LABEL YOUR TEAS MORE CAREFULLY FROM NOW ON!\n",

      "I must admit, I haven't gotten many gift baskets in my time. If this one is any indication of what a gift basket is like, Iam not missing anything!!!!<br /><br />To start with, the gift basket is wrapped in cellophane, with a wide dark brown ribbon, with a sticker that says Back Mountain Gift Baskets.  The basket looks like a generic, cheap looking Easter basket, with two handles, one on each side of the basket.  Iam not sure what they are made of.  Inside where the items are, they are nestled in what looks like straw.<br /><br />Now, on to the items inside.<br /><br />1.  A wrapped box that says Kenzi All Natural Dark Napolitans.  Inside that is a box of Raisinettes.  Inside of that is 6 individual, small, solid dark chocolate, thin, red  wrapped bars, which had a gray tinge to them.<br /><br />2.  Next was a wrapped Chocolate Chip Crispie Marshmallow Bar it said on the package.  Inside was a box of Goya Spanish Flan Style Custard..  Inside that was a rice crispie bar with small chocolate chips.  I took a bite of it.  It was not nearly as good as the rice crispie bars you can make at home.  Not by a longshot!!<br /><br />3.  Next was a box of Venus Stoned Wheat Wafers. Inside were 3 cracker wafers.<br /><br />4.  Next was a Lindt Lindor Truffles Mint Chocolate package.  There were 3 inside, individually wrapped.<br /><br />5.Next was a Belgin Truffles box, with 4 individually wrapped inside.<br /><br />6.  Next was a Italian Herb Cheese Spread Box, 3.5 ounces, in a white plastic container.<br /><br />7.  Next was a box of Caramels Fleur De Sel.  Inside that was a box of Crystal Light Lemonade Box.  Inside that was 5 individually wrapped caramels.<br /><br />8.  Next was a box of Ferrara Milk Chocolate Covered Raisins Box, with grayish what looks like covered raisins.<br /><br />9.  Next was a box that said Milk Chocolate Napolitans.  Inside that was a Royal box of cherry gelatin.  Inside that is 6 individual, thin, small brown wrapped bars.  Like the Dark, Kenzi All Natural Napolitans.  They too had a grayish tinge to them.<br /><br />10.  Next was a box of Cafe Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee Bars. Inside was 4 Coffee Vergano thin, solid packaged bars.  Not sure it it's coffee or not.<br /><br />11 and 12.  Next was a one ounce bag of Trophy Farms All Natural Oven Roasted Peanuts, and a one ounce bag of Trophy Farms All Natural Fruit and Nuts.<br /><br />13.  Next was a sachet type box of Ernest Hemingway Highland Select Tea with 4 individually wrapped Ernest Hemingway tea bags.<br /><br />14.  Next was a box that said Stauffer's Original Recipe Ginger Snaps.  Inside was a box that said Stauffer's Original Animal Crackers.  Inside of that was a 2.3 ounce package of Stauffer's Original Recipe Ginger Snaps.<br /><br />I didn't see any coffee that I know of, and I definitely did not see any salami as stated in the description that I read.<br /><br />When I asked to receive this basket, by the description it sounded like it would be a United Nations Basket, with items from other countries which intrigued me.

I didn't find it funny at all!! I definitely would NOT send this to someone else, especially if it were someone I loved, or even liked, unless you are trying to get even with someone, but I couldn't even do that!<br /><br />In a nutshell, I am disappointed, to say the least! This just proves to me, that what you see online when you order something, it may not be what you thought at all when you actually do receive what you ordered!!<br /><br />These are my opinions only.  Someone else might enjoy this gift basket. I didn't!  It's cheap looking, the items inside are cheap looking, etc.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I did receive another gift basket today.

All I can do which is what I did in my first review, and that is to state what products were included in this second gift basket, and leave the rest of it up to any potential buyers out there who are considering purchasing a gift basket from this or any other company.<br /><br />I do appreciate getting a second gift basket, which after the first one I was kind of dreading what I would receive in this second gift basket, but this one too does NOT have any wow factor, or quality look to it.<br /><br />To me, especially if it were something like a gift basket it would not only be about the products included, which would be high quality products, but quality packaging too which I enjoy trying products from other companies, perhaps products I had never tried before, but to me it's not only about the items included in the gift basket, but the presentation too matters to me.  It shouldn't show cheap.<br /><br />Also, I don't understand how any company who specializes in gift baskets would include items that you could easily find in any grocery store, but their's is lower quality.<br /><br />How much thought goes into this companies gift baskets?  If I were a company who made gift baskets, I would want it to look like alot of thought went into what they included in their gift basket, from the items they include to their packaging, etc.  It's the total package that matters to me in the end.  I would want my gift baskets to be memorable, thoughtful and enjoyable.  With this company their gift baskets are forgettable, sadly.<br /><br />If I had to rate this second gift basket by how many stars I would give it, I would have to give it a 2, and that is being generous.<br /><br />Sorry, that is just how I see it!\n",

      "As a \"royal-watcher\" since childhood, I did a double-take and stopped short, walking back to where I had been, when I saw this in my periferal vision, several years ago, in the supermarket.  It was that CROWN and that ROBE that Mr. Newman was wearing that got my eye.<br /><br />\"Royal Tea\" from Paul Newman's enterprises!  Why not?  I mean -- who deserved to name his tea \"Royal Tea\" than this superstar whose charitable heart was as good as his acting skills, and as wonderful as his ever-handsome looks?  The maverick in me has always liked the slightly-cocky half-smile Mr. Newman gave so often on the screen.  It was as if he had a touch -- just a touch, mind you -- of anger at our \"esteemed\" leadership, and at authority in general....just as I have?  Probably....<br /><br />Anyway, I bought the tea, and found it's flavour really good.  Tasty tea -- thy name is NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS ROYAL TEA, ORGANIC BLACK TEA, 100 INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED TEA BAGS, 7.05-OUNCE BOXES, (PACK OF 6).  It has a light, but very bold flavour.  And a very good flavour, too!<br /><br />I have recently found I must cut down on my favourite sweetener, SPLENDA. (TOO much of anything isn't good -- and too much SPLENDA, at least in my case, was beginning to affect my liver!)  I've partially solved this problem by putting TWO tea-bags in a slightly larger cup, (actually a 22-ounce glass), and this allows me to cut down on my Splenda packets.  It also gives the tea a more robust taste.<br /><br />The message on the back of the box, from Mr. Newman's daughter, Nell, (who appears with him in Royal roobes on the front), is funny, and a priceless view into the mind and heart of the sadly late Mr. Newman.  Who knows, but that he, (and Nell), may very well have had royal ancestors?  He was certainly handsome enough, (and Nell quite beautiful enough), to have this actually be true.  The message is delightful, and I am so glad it has been continued on the box.  (One note to Nell, thoough: a \"perilous\" person is one who is usually a villain(ess).  I take it that you are NOT \"perilous\", but \"imperilled\", (someone who IN danger.)  Please check<br />with the dictionary to be sure I am right on this!<br /><br />I've been fortunate enough to be able to sample the English FORTUM & MASON's \"Royal Blend Tea\".  It is very tasty, too -- but also imported, and thus,<br />very expensive.  NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS ROYAL TEA, ORGANIC BLACK TEA, is really tasty, less expensive, and truly an AMERICAN tea.  It proves, in a totally American way, that one need not be a king or queen, to enjoy the very best!  If Mr. Newman's ancestors WERE royal, he was continuing in the BEST of royal traditions, by sharing his bounty, (at a very reasonable cost), with those of us who admire all he did.  If his ancestors weren't royal....well, this truly delicious tea proves that ANYONE, no matter what their ancestry --  with enough heart, backing, and expertise -- can produce an exceptional-tasting tea at reasonable cost.<br /><br />\"King Paul\" remains in our hearts, and in our happiest memories.  \"Queen Nell\" has our respect, our love, and our admiration.  This black tea -- the black tea that so many of us grew up on -- is our traditional tea, upgraded to a \"royal\" standard by being organic.  Mr. Newman's company also produces organic green tea, which has its own great taste and health benefits.  But for we traditionalists....black tea is it.  And organic black tea that is SO tasty, truly makes anyone who drinks it,<br />feel quite royal, indeed!\n",

      "Culinary Teas Gourmet Teas Pumpkin Spice Tea<br /><br />Price: >$16 (4oz bag shipping added to my total) Purchased through amazon<br /><br />Caff-O-Meter: Undetermined, I'd estimate 15-30 since the base is not all black tea<br />Ingredients:<br />Luxury Black tea, Hibiscus, Rosehip, Almond pieces, Cinnamon pieces, Rooibos, Vanilla pieces, Apple pieces + Natural dried Orange, Sunflower + Calendula petals, Triacetin, Natural flavors.<br /><br />-Smell (.5) - The smell is not very strong nor does it remind me of pumpkin  or fall.

So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (1.5)- Adding the sweetener (.5 pkg of truvia) usually makes flavors stick out, and until I added the sweetener I didn't detect anything other than just black tea.<br />++Iced (2) -  So Iced with sweetener is the only way I find this tea to be enjoyable.<br /><br />2nd Steep (2) it maintains its flavor through a second steep but I'm still not impressed.<br /><br />Summary -  I really wanted to like this tea but it just didn't do it for me. The tea was very weak, perhaps I will try to double the strength in a few days and update my rating. to me it just tastes very bland.<br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp per 16 oz water) \"steep\" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference. I use plain Lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea).<br /><br />*** I have spoken with the seller who has assured me the tea is not old. You cant make everyone happy flavor wise and this was just not for my palette, I have a feeling it may be due to tea having no sweetener added and I prefer a sweetness to my tea. I am very pleased with the professionalism of the seller  and I will be giving them the full rating.\n",

      "I have been a fan of Jasmine Tea for quite a while.  Several years ago,<br />I had my first taste of TWINNINGS Jasmine Tea, and fell in love with the<br />sweet, delicate flavour....totally different from even the \"English Breakfast Tea\" made by the same company.  Though \"English Breakfast Tea\",<br />(and \"Darjeeling\", and even Fortum & Mason's \"Royal Blend\" tea are different from the usual \"Orange Pekoe\" or \"Orange Pekoe and Black\" teas, one usually gets bagged in the supermarket, these other 'rarified' teas are far more like the usual tea than Jasmine Tea.  Jasmine Tea, (at least as made by Twinnings), will always be my total favourite.<br /><br />When I went to purchase some \"TWINNINGS Jasmine Tea\" through Amazon, they were out of it...thank goodness, as it turns out, temporarily.  I didn't know this at the time...and so, I bought the \"substitute\" then offered...Sunflower Jasmine Tea.  I figured that Jasmine Tea is Jasmine Tea, no matter who makes it ....right?  And this Sunflower Tea DID seem slightly less expensive....so, I bought some.<br /><br />I have just had my first cup.  It did NOT taste like the Jasmine Tea I so remember and appreciate.  This is a very, very PALE tea in colour....and what is worse, the taste is somewhat peppery, (ulgh!)....with only the VERY slightest hint of the wonderful Jasmine Tea Flavour I remember.<br /><br />WHAT went wrong, I wondered.  HOW could this be so different?  Tea trees<br />should know no nationality or political system!  I was extremely bewildered and confused....for about five minutes.  But I found out the reason, (I think), just before I started to write this review...seeking out the Sunflower Jasmine Tea for which I wanted to write a review.<br /><br />Amongst the \"Jasmine Teas\" listed are TWO TYPES of Twinnings Jasmine Tea.<br />One is \"Jasmine Tea\", the other \"Jasmine Green Tea\".  I suspect that THIS is the reason I so dislike the Jasmine Tea from Sunflower.  It is NOT \"straight\" Jasmine Tea...but MUST be Jasmine Green Tea.  And although Green Tea is said to have myriad health benefits, it sure doesn't make as tasty and satisfying a brew as Jasmine tea.  Even when, it seems, it is MIXED with Jasmine Tea.<br /><br />One would expect people in the People's Republic of China to know the difference!  And to label their tea accordingly!  Not everyone, (including me!) is a tea expert...and the difference between \"Jasmine Tea\" and \"Jasmine Green Tea\" should be noted on the tea-box label, for tea novices, such as I...as it is, thoughtfully, by Twinnings Teas.  I am, at present, extremely disappointed at the carelessness in labeling.<br />Those who want \"Jasmine Tea\" only will, I am sure, be likewise disappointed by this probably-mislabeled-by-mistake-or-by-carelessness \"Jasmine Tea\".  It is NOT \"Jasmine Tea\" to my palate -- it is, I am almost certain, \"Jasmine Green Tea\".  There is SUCH a difference in taste!!!!!!<br /><br />I know Green Tea is good for one, and so I will keep this tea.  I will combine it with the \"ordinary\" tea I find at the supermarket -- and which I find far more flavourful!  (NOTE: Second cup of tea -- even mixed with \"ordinary\" orange pekoe tea, (two tea-bags!), is not to my taste.  Therefore....as is listed in the \"NOTE: PS\",  below, I HAVE DECIDED I AM NOT KEEPING this tea, but am putting it up for sale, for those who enjoy Jasmine Green Tea, (obviously some people do, as reflected in the other, sterling reviews of this tea), and would like it -- 1 pound minus two servings -- at a bargain price.)<br /><br />However, this tea is certainly not to MY taste.  And so disappointed am I, that, unless there is a very, very great difference in price, I will stick to buying genuine,<br />\"JASMINE Tea\", from Twinnings, (who takes the time and trouble to carefully label each TYPE of Jasmine Tea), from now on -- even if Sunflower does decide to mend it's ways and re-label its tea!<br /><br />A great flavor disappointment -- due to careless labelling!<br /><br />.............................................................<br />.............................................................<br /><br />p.S.  NOTE:  Today, 12th March, 2009 -- two days after I have written this review -- and about 6 days after I have received this tea, I have FINALLY seen that, yes indeedy....the package DOES say, \"Green Tea With Jasmine Flowers\" -- on the BACK of the tin, in smallish lettering!  One cannot see the BACK of the tin from the Amazon.com illustration!  From the \"Product Description\", it states that \"Jasmine Tea is one of the most pleasant-tasting green teas available....\" -- but does NOT mention any differentiation between the two varieties: \"Jasmine Tea\", ane \"Jasmine Green Tea\" -- as Twinnings Teas thoughtfully does.  Even from the \"Proudct Description\", which probably has been supplied by Sunflower, a novice would STILL not know there are two distinct and different TYPES of Jasmine Tea!  AND THERE DEFINITELY ARE TWO VARIETIES: - I have been on the phone with my sister, and she concurs: she (also), LOVES plain Jasmine Tea, but detests Jasmine GREEN Tea.  But -- I suppopose there ARE those who enjoy Jasmine Green Tea, looking at the ohter sterling reviews of this same tea.<br /><br />I don't like it. But I'm glad that there are those who do like it.  I have had two cups of 5his tea -- and have revised my opinion about keeping it.  I am putting it up for sale, via my Amazon.com shop.  I may lose mnney in this transaction, but better that, (for me), than suffering through more of this Jasmine Green Tea.  Besides, there PROBABLY ARE others who like it.  I guess I'll not only be doing myself a favour -- but will also be doing my \"good deed\" for the day, by putting it up at a bargain price for those who truly enjoy Jasmine GREEN Tea!  If you want to buy it, it's here -- used only twice, at the aforesaid bargain price! (Hey, that rhymes!)<br /><br />Note to Sunflower Teas:  PLEASE LABEL YOUR TEAS MORE CAREFULLY FROM NOW ON!\n",

      "I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I\">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I\">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a> has a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.<br /><br />If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0\">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64F6\">SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY03TC\">Bigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.\n",

Inside that was a rice crispie bar with small chocolate chips.  I took a bite of it.  It was not nearly as good as the rice crispie bars you can make at home.  Not by a longshot!!<br /><br />3.

Like the Dark, Kenzi All Natural Napolitans.  They too had a grayish tinge to them.<br /><br />10.  Next was a box of Cafe Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee Bars. Inside was 4 Coffee Vergano thin, solid packaged bars.  Not sure it it's coffee or not.<br /><br />11 and 12.  Next was a one ounce bag of Trophy Farms All Natural Oven Roasted Peanuts, and a one ounce bag of Trophy Farms All Natural Fruit and Nuts.<br /><br />13.  Next was a sachet type box of Ernest Hemingway Highland Select Tea with 4 individually wrapped Ernest Hemingway tea bags.<br /><br />14.  Next was a box that said Stauffer's Original Recipe Ginger Snaps.  Inside was a box that said Stauffer's Original Animal Crackers.  Inside of that was a 2.3 ounce package of Stauffer's Original Recipe Ginger Snaps.<br /><br />I didn't see any coffee that I know of, and I definitely did not see any salami as stated in the description that I read.<br /><br />When I asked to receive this basket, by the description it sounded like it would be a United Nations Basket, with items from other countries which intrigued me.  Instead each item was made in the United States.<br /><br />Sadly, I would have much preferred the fake boxes of Jello, Crystal Light, Flan Custard, and Animal Crackers, rather than what the real items was.  At least I recognized the fake boxes, and they would have actually been something I could have used.<br /><br />What I got, most of it I plan to throw away.<br /><br />If in the description it says with a celebration in mind, the joke is on me, or I didn't get the joke, even tho I do have a good sense of humor.<br /><br />The endless unwrapping of each item, I wouldn't have minded if they had been quality items, but when I was finished unwrapping everything I was  just glad it was over!!<br /><br />I don't at this point know what this gift basket will be selling for, but to me, even a dollar would be too much!<br /><br />This basket was more like a gag gift to me.  I didn't find it funny at all!! I definitely would NOT send this to someone else, especially if it were someone I loved, or even liked, unless you are trying to get even with someone, but I couldn't even do that!<br /><br />In a nutshell, I am disappointed, to say the least! This just proves to me, that what you see online when you order something, it may not be what you thought at all when you actually do receive what you ordered!!<br /><br />These are my opinions only.  Someone else might enjoy this gift basket. I didn't!  It's cheap looking, the items inside are cheap looking, etc.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I did receive another gift basket today. The one that I received today was NOT the same gift basket that I had received when I wrote my original review above.<br /><br />By that I mean the gift basket that I received today was NOT the original one that I got, not the prototype above, but not even the same gift basket that I had received minus the wierdness, tackyness, and about a hundred other words that I could write to give a description of the FIRST nightmare of a gift basket that I had received.<br /><br />The only similarity from the original gift basket and then this second gift basket is that it's the same gift basket, but the one I received today is a darker color.  Everything else about it is the same as the first gift basket I received, the actual basket.<br /><br />There was a note taped to the outside of this gift basket showing that the orginal gift basket I received was a pre-production, prototype, mock-up that was never intended to be released to the general public.  I HOPE NOT!!!<br /><br />It never occured to me that any gift basket I would ever receive would not be the one that anyone else would have received.<br /><br />Obviously this company needs better quality control, because the one I originally received I never would have let it see the light of day, period.<br /><br />I was hoping that the gift basket that I received today would be the one I originally was supposed to receive to see how it really should have been, but the one I got today is an entirely different gift basket all together.<br /><br />The gift basket I received today was one entirely devoted to coffee, period.  It included:<br /><br />1.  A can of Ground Irish Coffee- 1.75 ounces. The brand is Bewley's Of Ireland, but on the back of the can it says Comfort Foods, Inc.  North Andover, MA.  I will be giving this coffee away.  I can't stand anything that is Irish Cream, no matter what it is.<br /><br />2.  3 packets of different ground coffees, each 1.3 ounces, in flavors of Breakfast Blend, Amaretto Royale, and Moca Java, from a company called Arbuckle's.  The city is Verona, PA.  Each packet of coffee is supposed to make about 10 cups of coffee depending on how strong you like it.<br /><br />3. A coffee mug that says a warm mug of Coffee, the best at igourment.com.  Your standard sized mug.  The writing is in a brown color, the mug itself is like an off white/beige color.  I will also be giving this mug away.  It's just not the kind of mug that I use either for coffee or tea.  The mug is ok, for what it is.<br /><br />4.  A small box that says Sugar in the raw, that has 6 packets.  I know I can buy this same brand in any grocery store.<br /><br />4.  A taller box that says Creamer for your coffee.  Inside that box is 10 packets of a generic looking non-dairy creamer.  I will also be giving this away as I don't use powdered creamer at all, but a liquid flavored creamer.<br /><br />5.A taller box that says Coffee Stirrers.  Inside that are 9 wooden coffee stirrers, like a thin popsicle stick. They aren't even plastic coffee stirrers!<br /><br />6.  A roll of King Original Peppermints which I assume is some kind of mints- 1.55 ounces.<br /><br />7.  A box of Caffe' Vergnano 1882 Biscoffee- 0.83 ounces.  I did receive this same thing in my first gift basket.  They taste like almond cookies.  The box says Product of Italy, but on the back of the box the state shown is PA.  Hardly Italy!<br /><br />8.  Several small packets of biscuit type cookies, to have with coffee.  About 6 of those total.<br /><br />In summary this gift basket was not the tacky, etc one like the first gift basket that I received, but I wouldn't call this one great either.  I wouldn't send this gift basket to anyone I know.  It doesn't look gourmet to me at all.<br /><br />The only things I will be keeping are the packets of coffee, the sugar in the raw, tho as a rule I don't use sugar period, and never in coffee.  I just use flavored liquid creamer in my coffee, and maybe the basket.  The rest I will be giving away.<br /><br />It's really hard to give an update since this second gift basket is not like the first one I received as far as the contents of the basket.<br /><br />I hate to say this, and I will leave it up to anyone who cares to read my review as to if they want to purchase either of these gift baskets or any others from this company, but I  don't like this company, period.<br /><br />They lack any imagination as far as the products/packaging they include in their gift baskets, which if I had to rate the gift baskets based soley on the contents of what was included in either gift basket, I would have to say the first gift basket I received had more variety than this second gift basket did.  I could see what the contents of the first gift basket would have contained, minus all of the wierd packaging that it had, tho some of the products of that one looked old, non-edible.  I threw most of that one away, period.  I didn't even give any of that gift basket away.<br /><br />My real question and my summary of this company is if it's named igourmet, where is the gourmet in their products?  Also, they are supposed to be products that are not from the U.S.A., but once again both gift baskets contained items only from the U.S.A.<br /><br />Most of what they include in their gift baskets, I could find either the same products or higher quality products than theirs in any grocery store.<br /><br />Like I said, it's hard to update a review if the gift baskets are entirely different, how can you compare them to post a review?  All I can do which is what I did in my first review, and that is to state what products were included in this second gift basket, and leave the rest of it up to any potential buyers out there who are considering purchasing a gift basket from this or any other company.<br /><br />I do appreciate getting a second gift basket, which after the first one I was kind of dreading what I would receive in this second gift basket, but this one too does NOT have any wow factor, or quality look to it.<br /><br />To me, especially if it were something like a gift basket it would not only be about the products included, which would be high quality products, but quality packaging too which I enjoy trying products from other companies, perhaps products I had never tried before, but to me it's not only about the items included in the gift basket, but the presentation too matters to me.  It shouldn't show cheap.<br /><br />Also, I don't understand how any company who specializes in gift baskets would include items that you could easily find in any grocery store, but their's is lower quality.<br /><br />How much thought goes into this companies gift baskets?  If I were a company who made gift baskets, I would want it to look like alot of thought went into what they included in their gift basket, from the items they include to their packaging, etc.  It's the total package that matters to me in the end.  I would want my gift baskets to be memorable, thoughtful and enjoyable.  With this company their gift baskets are forgettable, sadly.<br /><br />If I had to rate this second gift basket by how many stars I would give it, I would have to give it a 2, and that is being generous.<br /><br />Sorry, that is just how I see it!\n",

      "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",
